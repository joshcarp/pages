# Chatbot Setup Instructions

## Getting Your Gemini API Key

The chatbot uses Google's Gemini Flash model, which requires a free API key. Here's how to get one:

1. **Visit Google AI Studio**: Go to [https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

2. **Sign in**: Use your Google account to sign in

3. **Create API Key**: Click "Create API Key" button

4. **Copy the key**: Copy the generated API key (it will look like: `AIza...`)

5. **Use in chatbot**: When you first click the chat button, you'll be prompted to enter this key

## Features

The chatbot can help with:
- **Schedule questions**: Event times, activities, calendar integration
- **Accommodation**: Room details, check-in/out times, accessibility
- **Transportation**: Shuttle schedules, airport/ferry connections
- **Costs**: Registration fees, payment methods
- **Kids activities**: Camp schedules, supervision details
- **Weather**: What to pack, climate information
- **Contacts**: Staff contacts, emergency numbers

## Fallback Mode

If you don't provide an API key, the chatbot will still work with pre-programmed responses for common questions. For the full AI experience with natural language understanding, use the Gemini API key.

## Privacy

Your API key is stored locally in your browser and only used to communicate directly with Google's Gemini service. The key is not sent to any other servers.
